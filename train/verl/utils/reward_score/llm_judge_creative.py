Follow the following rubric to score the creative writing piece:

Detailed Rubric (0–100 Points)
Category 1: Originality & Inventiveness (0–10 points)
0–2:
The work is heavily derivative or cliché.
Very little new or surprising in the concept, style, or approach.

Overall effect still feels quite familiar.
5–6:
Moderately original, with clear attempts to develop unique ideas or scenarios.
Some interesting twists or creative flourishes.
Certain sections stand out as inventive, though not consistently.
7–8:
Strongly inventive and often surprising; the writer's personal vision is evident.
Elements of the story or poem break new ground or subvert expectations.
The overall voice, style, or concept is distinct.
9–10:
Remarkably original, challenging conventional boundaries.
The piece stands out as highly creative and distinctive from most contemporary writing.
A consistent sense of innovation throughout.
Achieving a 10 here is exceptionally rare.
Category 2: Depth & Complexity of Themes (0–10 points)
0–2:
Themes are absent, trivial, or muddled.
Writing may be purely surface-level or lack coherence in its core message.
3–4:
Themes are present but simplistic or underdeveloped.
An attempt at deeper issues, but execution is perfunctory or shallow.

Offers more than a surface reading, though insights may remain basic.
7–8:

9–10:
Rich thematic tapestry woven with subtlety and nuance.
Themes resonate profoundly, inviting extended reflection or discussion.

0–2:
Characters (or persona) feel flat, generic, or inconsistent.
No meaningful growth, motivation, or backstory.
3–4:
Some basic definition of characters, but they remain mostly one-dimensional.

9–10:
Characters feel fully alive, with nuanced psychology and layered motivations.
Their voices or perspectives profoundly shape the narrative or poem.
Readers can strongly empathize and see genuine transformation or revelation.
Category 4: Plot / Narrative Arc (0–10 points)

0–2:
Little sense of progression; events or ideas are scattered, incoherent, or incomplete.
3–4:
A basic beginning, middle, and end exist, but transitions may be choppy or underdeveloped.
The structure might be muddled or rely on contrivances.
5–6:
A coherent arc is present, though it may be somewhat predictable or lack dramatic tension.
The work demonstrates some structural planning.
7–8:
A well-crafted arc, whether linear or experimental, that engages and guides the reader effectively.
Pacing and transitions generally feel smooth and purposeful.
9–10:
Exceptionally cohesive and compelling structure, whether traditional or avant-garde.

Every device feels purposefully placed, contributing to an immersive or profound experience.
Category 7: Clarity, Coherence & Flow (0–10 points)
0–2:
Disjointed writing that is hard to follow.
Paragraphs or stanzas show no logical sequence; numerous confusing transitions.

Feels rote or hollow, with minimal resonance.
3–4:
Some emotional moments or ideas spark mild interest, but they are fleeting or underexplored.
The piece tries to engage readers, but the effect is inconsistent.

The piece could benefit from further proofreading or formatting consistency.
7–8:
Well-edited and generally polished; only a few mistakes here and there.
Formatting is professional and consistent.
9–10:
Impeccably proofread; errors are nearly non-existent.
Professional-level attention to detail in formatting, citations (if needed), and layout.
Demonstrates high standards typical of a graduate or professional setting.
Scoring & Guidelines
Each of the 10 categories is worth up to 10 points, for a total of 0–100 possible points.
Use the descriptors in each category to choose an appropriate integer score from 0 to 10 (no half points).
Sum the category scores for a total mark out of 100.
Because this is a tough graduate-level rubric, achieving scores above 90 should be exceedingly rare, reserved for near-publishable or professional-quality work.

Output your score in this exact format:
