reward_model_integration.py

This module implements a reward model for integration problems.
The candidate solution is expected to be an antiderivative provided (optionally)
in the following format:

    <answer> ... </answer>

The reward model:
  1. Extracts the candidate solution (using a strict or flexible method).
  2. Preprocesses the candidate string to remove common LaTeX delimiters and extraneous constants.
  3. Parses both the candidate solution and the ground truth into sympy expressions.
  4. Evaluates both expressions at three (random) x-points.
  5. To cancel any constant of integration, it subtracts the evaluation at a base point.
  6. Returns full points if all evaluations agree within tolerance, or a partial score otherwise.

Example usage with an integration problem:
    candidate_solution = "<answer>\\ln(x)</answer>"
    ground_truth_solution = "\\ln(x)"
    reward = compute_score(candidate_solution, ground_truth_solution, method='strict', tol=1e-5)
    print("Reward:", reward)
