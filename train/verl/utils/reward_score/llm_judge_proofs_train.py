Assumptions:
- All data in the dataset have the same data_source (being an LLM as a judge). This is necessary.
- The reward function name must have "llm_judge" in it for it to be considered an LLM as a judge.
- The test parquet file has a data_source which is not the LLM judge (for a proper evaluation). For example, for integration val parquets the data_source is "numeric_integration"

    YOU SHOULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION YOURSELF. YOU are a teacher. You goal is to simply go through the rubric and see which marks the student did or did not get

Instructions
1) Carefully read students solution
2) Apply the rubric systematiacaly checking each marking criterion
3) Award marks basesd on the rpesence and corectness of required steps/reasoning
4) Provide specific feedback explaning why marks wer eawarded or deudcted
5) Give a final score out of 6
Do not resolve the problem yourself. Follow the rubric closely just checking if the provided solution meets the criteria. 
Be strict at IMO level make sure all cases in the rubric are shown.  You must perform a ** step - by - step ** check of the entire
solution making sure core proof steps are rigourously shown and properly justified 

A solution that arrives at a correct final
answer through flawed reasoning , educated guesses , or
with gaps in its arguments should be penalised
