As the Visitor causes destruction wherever it goes, the three teens struggle to survive and warn others of what\u2019s coming\u2014because this Visitor is only the first of many. But who is their true enemy\u2014this alien, or their fellow humans?\nPura Belpr\u00e9 Honor-winning author Lilliam Rivera examines the days before a\nWar of the Worlds-\ninspired alien invasion in this captivating and chilling new novel.\nChapter 1\nFive days before the Visitor lands, Pedro has an unusual encounter at the bus stop where he always waits for the 7 a.m. bus to take him to Fairfax High. There\u2019s a dense morning fog that sweeps across the streets adding to Pedro\u2019s drowsiness. Last night he went to La Plaza to watch Kandi perform. It was the late Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal\u2019s birthday, and Kandi was deep in his emotions. The flawless performer lip-synched to \u201cAmor Eterno\u201d with tears streaming down his immaculately painted face. Pedro sat at his usual corner table in awe of the emotional display, so much so that he too succumbed to a tear or two.\nPedro\u2019s not technically allowed in the twenty-one-and-over club, but La Plaza has been his sometime home for so long that the owner overlooks his age. La Plaza is the only place Pedro feels safe, and because of that, Pedro frequently stays out way too late. But he\u2019s never tardy to school no matter how many times the club calls to him. He would never allow his \u201cmisguided antics\u201d to get in the way of showing out academically and aesthetically.\nDressed in a combination of his two favorite stunners\u2014pop star Kali Uchis and the principe de chocolate Andr\u00e9s from the only television show that counts,\nLos Espookys\n\u2014Pedro looks primed to battle any drama in sequin joggers and blue high-tops.

      "reference_story": "But Pedro, Luna, and Rafa find themselves thrown together when an extraterrestrial visitor lands in their city and takes the form of Luna\u2019s cousin Tasha. As the Visitor causes destruction wherever it goes, the three teens struggle to survive and warn others of what\u2019s coming\u2014because this Visitor is only the first of many. But who is their true enemy\u2014this alien, or their fellow humans?\nPura Belpr\u00e9 Honor-winning author Lilliam Rivera examines the days before a\nWar of the Worlds-\ninspired alien invasion in this captivating and chilling new novel.\nChapter 1\nFive days before the Visitor lands, Pedro has an unusual encounter at the bus stop where he always waits for the 7 a.m. bus to take him to Fairfax High. There\u2019s a dense morning fog that sweeps across the streets adding to Pedro\u2019s drowsiness. Last night he went to La Plaza to watch Kandi perform. It was the late Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal\u2019s birthday, and Kandi was deep in his emotions. The flawless performer lip-synched to \u201cAmor Eterno\u201d with tears streaming down his immaculately painted face. Pedro sat at his usual corner table in awe of the emotional display, so much so that he too succumbed to a tear or two.\nPedro\u2019s not technically allowed in the twenty-one-and-over club, but La Plaza has been his sometime home for so long that the owner overlooks his age. La Plaza is the only place Pedro feels safe, and because of that, Pedro frequently stays out way too late. But he\u2019s never tardy to school no matter how many times the club calls to him. He would never allow his \u201cmisguided antics\u201d to get in the way of showing out academically and aesthetically.\nDressed in a combination of his two favorite stunners\u2014pop star Kali Uchis and the principe de chocolate Andr\u00e9s from the only television show that counts,\nLos Espookys\n\u2014Pedro looks primed to battle any drama in sequin joggers and blue high-tops.
