I exist in the outer skin of the Generation Ship\nOlympia,\nand I spend most of my time squeezing through its utility tunnels, doing work for the Executives. I am partially deaf, dumb, and blind. That I am not\nentirely\nso is my greatest secret. It is the reason I was able to kill Ryan Charmayne two hours after curfew, inside Lock 212.\nDon\u2019t feel bad for Ryan. He was there to commit murder, too. He thought he was going to bump off a rival who was using Lock 212 to rendezvous with a mole from his inner circle. The fact that Ryan didn\u2019t know who the mole was may have been the reason he didn\u2019t order someone else to do the killing, but it wasn\u2019t the only reason he came in person. Ryan enjoyed the dirty work. He just couldn\u2019t afford to stoop to it as often as he would like, considering his lofty position in the House of Clans.\nCurfew doesn\u2019t apply to Executives, so Ryan roamed at will. His brethren rarely had business in the tunnels where we wormy folk live; he felt sure no one would see him. He hardly seemed to mind that it was cold enough to make his breath condense into mist as he marched through the tangle of narrow corridors.\nI felt a grudging admiration. If only his character were as fine as his sense of direction.\nThe air locks in Sector 200 are massive; they were built to accommodate cargo ships. They possess an odd, almost Gothic beauty because of their vaulted ceilings and curved outer doors. They\u2019re the only wide-open spaces most worms can access on\nOlympia.\nTheir grandeur inspires me.\nAir locks inspired Ryan for a different reason.

Standing at this precipice, my breath caught in my throat. Great heights were not an issue for me, but this enormous gap took even my breath away. a scar right through the forests and grasslands on the border of koton and Detrata, it was a mile long and eight hundred feet wide, and an imposing sight. Down the cliff faces, birds spiralled towards their nests among the nooks, and at the very bottom, barely seen, were the white tips of a river in full flow.\nThe wind began to pick up, offering relief from the humidity, as I strode across one of the four wooden bridges leading to the central village, which stood atop a single island of rock in the centre of the chasm.

He is the winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, in addition to many other awards. Born and raised in Southern California, he now lives in suburban Washington, DC.\nThe congregation sang a hymn, \u201cGod Will Take Care of You.\u201d To Adam Simon, the words felt hollow and thin, an assertion of confidence he did not feel, but he followed along in the hymnal anyway, joined his voice to all the others, throwing the words against an apprehension, a certainty of doom, that made his stomach ache. \u201c\nBe not dismayed, whatever betide\n,\u201d he sang, \u201c\nGod will take care of you\n.\u201d\n\nBut was God here in Selma, Alabama? Could even God keep a rein on that crazy sheriff, Jim Clark? Or were they all just kidding themselves?\nHe knew the thought was blasphemy. His mother would be disappointed in him, though of course, that was nothing new. He had lived his entire life with a pervasive sense that he had somehow let Thelma Simon down, though he could never say just how. And as to his dad, well .\u00a0.\u00a0. if the Reverend George Simon ever caught wind of those sacrilegious thoughts, he\u2019d probably disown him, only child or not.\nBut Adam couldn\u2019t help what he felt\u2014or, more to the point, didn\u2019t feel. After a moment, he stopped singing. The other voices crested on without him, a grainy mix\u2014not quite harmony\u2014of men\u2019s uneven baritones and women\u2019s trembly sopranos. \u201c\nBeneath his wings of love abide\n,\u201d they sang. \u201c\nGod will take care of you\n.\u201d\nAbove the pulpit, a cross made of light beamed down on the congregation. Several of the bulbs were burned out, leaving splotches of darkness on this symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering and victory. It seemed apropos. Adam had never been so scared.
